                        This is a complete example of a forum website. SDLF stands for Saeed Doozandeh Laravel Forum. It
                        can be updated gradually. In this
                        project, I have tried to show every aspect
                        of a website in laravel, including CRUD, pagination, connecting to Telegram and sending
                        messages, notifications, privileges and access for each user, admins and clients, writing
                        comments, replying to posts, showing online users, profile for each user and updating them, like
                        and dislike posts and give ranking to users in addition to being able to search based on the
                        intended column. &nbsp
                        This project has been developed with the latest version of laravel (12) and mysql has been used
                        for its database.
                        <br><br>

                        <strong>To run the project:</strong>
                        <ol>
                            <li>Clone the project from github and extract it.</li>
                            <li>Run it in an IDE, e.g. phpstorm or VSCode.</li>
                            <li>Run "php artisan migrate" to create the database and transfer all the necessary tables
                                to
                                database.(if it doesn't work, create the database in phpmyadmin.)
                            </li>
                            <li>Run "php artisan db:seed" to seed the database with the default data to run a complete
                                forum
                                website.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                        <strong>Default username and password with admin privileges) username: admin@admin.com password: admin@admin.com</strong>
                        <br>
                        This project can be further developed according to the customer's demand.
